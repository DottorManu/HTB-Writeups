# 🛠️ HTB Write-ups by DottorManu

Personal, no-frills reports for Hack The Box machines I felt were worth documenting.

> **Note:** I solved most HTB boxes in the past using anonymous accounts and never wrote anything down.  
> Only recently I’ve started publishing full write-ups — **whenever I feel like it** — and dropping them here. Expect sporadic updates, not a full catalogue.

| OUTBOUND | Easy | Linux | [outbound.htb.pdf](outbound.htb.pdf) |

Each PDF is self-contained: enumeration, exploitation, pivoting, privilege escalation, and take-aways.
