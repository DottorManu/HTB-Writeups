# 🛠️ HTB Write‑ups by DottorManu

Personal, no‑frills reports for Hack The Box machines I felt were worth documenting.

> **Note:** I solved most HTB boxes in the past using anonymous accounts and never wrote anything down.  
> Only recently I’ve started publishing full write‑ups — **whenever I feel like it** — and dropping them here. Expect sporadic updates, not a full catalogue.

| HEAL | Medium     | Linux | [heal.htb.pdf](heal.htb.pdf) |

Each PDF is self‑contained: enumeration, exploitation, pivoting, privilege escalation, and take‑aways.
